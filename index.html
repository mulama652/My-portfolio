    <h2>The Skillful Journey</h2>
    <p class="story">In the heart of Nairobi, lived a determined and multi-talented young man named Ian Mulama. A
      student at Tangaza University, Ian wasn't just known for his sharp mind in History and Kiswahili, but also for the
      magic he created with his hands and heart.
      From a young age, Ian had always been curious—curious about how things worked, how people felt, and how stories
      could change lives. This curiosity pushed him into many paths: photography, graphic design, web development,
      teaching, and even video editing. While others chose one path, Ian chose to explore them all.

      His Sundays were spent at Karen Africa Gospel Church, not just worshipping but capturing the essence of every
      service through his camera lens. His photographs weren’t just pictures—they were memories, moments of faith frozen
      in time.
    </p>

    <p class="note">During elections, Ian served with IEBC, helping citizens exercise their democratic rights with
      integrity and calm. And when he walked into a classroom as a volunteer teacher at Nkaimurunya Comprehensive
      School, his voice echoed not just knowledge but compassion.

      But what truly set Ian apart wasn’t just what he could do—it was how he made people feel. Whether he was designing
      a church poster, teaching a class about religion, or coding a website for a small business, he poured his heart
      into it.

      Despite the many challenges life threw at him—including heartbreak and hard decisions—Ian chose to stay grounded,
      drawing strength from his faith and the values he held close.

      One day, he stood before a group of students and said, “Your skills are not just tools—they are gifts. Use them to
      lift others, and you’ll find your purpose.”

      And just like that, Ian Mulama’s journey continued—not just as a student or a teacher, but as a light in every
      space he stepped into.
