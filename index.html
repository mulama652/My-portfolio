    <h2>The Skillful Journey</h2>
    <p class="story">In the heart of Nairobi, my journey as a dedicated and multi-skilled individual has been shaped by a passion for learning, service, and creativity. My name is Ian Mulama, a teacher trainee at Tangaza University specializing in History and Kiswahili. My academic and professional path has been deeply influenced by both formal education and hands-on experiences that continue to refine my teaching philosophy and personal growth.

      Between May and August 4th, 2024, I undertook my school practice at Nkaimurunya Comprehensive School. This experience was transformative. It was my first opportunity to actively engage with learners in a real classroom setting, where I applied theoretical knowledge into practical teaching. From preparing schemes of work to delivering lessons and assessing student understanding, I grew more confident in managing classroom dynamics, understanding student needs, and tailoring my approach to accommodate diverse learning styles.
      
      Following this, I began my teaching practice at the same school from January 5th to April 4th, 2025. During this period, I further deepened my understanding of the learning and teaching environment. I learned to embrace flexibility, patience, and creativity in lesson delivery. I also developed a stronger sense of responsibility and professionalism, ensuring that every lesson was purposeful and engaging. This exposure taught me valuable skills in classroom management, effective communication, and curriculum implementation, which I believe will significantly enhance my adaptability and effectiveness in any future teaching environment.
    </p>

    <p class="note">Beyond the classroom, I actively participated in the 2022 General Elections in Kenya, serving as a clerk with the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). This role demanded integrity, accuracy, and the ability to work under pressure. It strengthened my skills in public service, data management, and handling sensitive responsibilities with utmost confidentiality and care.

      Creatively, I have also grown through my involvement with Karen Africa Gospel Church, where I serve in the media team. My responsibilities include photography, video editing, and poster design. Capturing moments during services and creating uplifting visual content has taught me to observe deeply, tell compelling stories, and appreciate the power of visual communication. Through this, I’ve enhanced my technical skills in video production and graphic design, using tools that allow me to communicate messages effectively and artistically.
      
      These experiences—whether in the classroom, during national service, or behind a camera lens—have contributed to my holistic development. They have taught me the value of discipline, empathy, teamwork, and innovation. I believe that every skill I’ve acquired is a gift meant to be used for the betterment of others.
      
      As I continue this journey, I remain committed to becoming a well-rounded educator and professional—someone who not only teaches but inspires, leads with purpose, and serves with integrity.
